//   - Attach errors describing what went wrong at WriteResult.Errors
//   - In case of successful create/update set the response item to WriteResult.Data.

// A Record is a domain-agnostic map/struct that models fields you want to persist.
// An Item is the wire representation (payload item) the provider expects for a single Record.
// Connectors must make an explicit mapping Record -> Item (payload item) when constructing the overall payload.
// When responses arrive, connectors must match each payload item to its response item and produce a WriteResult.
// This separation ensures consistent handling of ID mapping, reference IDs, partial successes, and errors.

//	R is the provider response item type (what was received).

// payloadItems - list of items that are part of payload to create/update each record.
// responseMatcher - list of items that are part of payload to create/update each record.
