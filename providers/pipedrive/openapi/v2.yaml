  - name: Activities
    description: |
      Activities are appointments/tasks/events on a calendar that can be associated with a deal, a lead, a person and an organization. Activities can be of different type (such as call, meeting, lunch or a custom type - see ActivityTypes object) and can be assigned to a particular user. Note that activities can also be created without a specific date/time.
  - name: Deals
    description: |
      Deals represent ongoing, lost or won sales to an organization or to a person. Each deal has a monetary value and must be placed in a stage. Deals can be owned by a user, and followed by one or many users. Each deal consists of standard data fields but can also contain a number of custom fields. The custom fields can be recognized by long hashes as keys. These hashes can be mapped against `DealField.key`. The corresponding label for each such custom field can be obtained from `DealField.name`.
  - name: Products
    description: |
      Products are the goods or services you are dealing with. Each product can have N different price points - firstly, each product can have a price in N different currencies, and secondly, each product can have N variations of itself, each having N prices in different currencies. Note that only one price per variation per currency is supported. Products can be instantiated to deals. In the context of instantiation, a custom price, quantity and discount can be applied.
  - name: Leads
    description: |
      Leads are potential deals stored in Leads Inbox before they are archived or converted to a deal. Each lead needs to be named (using the `title` field) and be linked to a person or an organization. In addition to that, a lead can contain most of the fields a deal can (such as `value` or `expected_close_date`).
  - name: Organizations
    description: |
      Organizations are companies and other kinds of organizations you are making deals with. Persons can be associated with organizations so that each organization can contain one or more persons.
  - name: Persons
    description: |
      Persons are your contacts, the customers you are doing deals with. Each person can belong to an organization. Persons should not be confused with users.
  - name: ItemSearch
    description: |
      Ordered reference objects, pointing to either deals, persons, organizations, leads, products, files or mail attachments.
  - name: Stages
    description: |
      Stage is a logical component of a pipeline, and essentially a bucket that can hold a number of deals. In the context of the pipeline a stage belongs to, it has an order number which defines the order of stages in that pipeline.
  - name: Pipelines
    description: |
      Pipelines are essentially ordered collections of stages.
  - name: Users
    description: |
      Users are individuals who have a Pipedrive account and can interact with its features.
  - name: Beta
    description: |

                                How often a customer is billed for access to a service or product

                                To set `billing_frequency` different than `one-time`, the deal must not have installments associated

                                A deal can have up to 20 products attached with `billing_frequency` different than `one-time`

                                The number of times the billing frequency repeats for a product in a deal

                                When `billing_frequency` is set to `one-time`, this field must be `null`

                                When `billing_frequency` is set to `weekly`, this field cannot be `null`

                                For all the other values of `billing_frequency`, `null` represents a product billed indefinitely

                                Must be a positive integer less or equal to 208

                                The number of times the billing frequency repeats for a product in a deal

                                When `billing_frequency` is set to `one-time`, this field must be `null`

                                When `billing_frequency` is set to `weekly`, this field cannot be `null`

                                For all the other values of `billing_frequency`, `null` represents a product billed indefinitely

                                Must be a positive integer less or equal to 208
