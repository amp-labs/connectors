// pre-allocate the catalog to the number of providers we think we have.
// This count is automatically updated by the catalog/json.go script,
// which runs anytime the catalog is updated.
//
// NOTE: There's no need to ever manually update the count. Even if it's
// off by a few (which isn't a big deal), it'll get corrected next time
// the script runs. So don't worry about it.
