        Creates a new price.

        Prices describe how you charge for products. You must include a `product_id` in your request to relate this price to a product.

        If you omit the `quantity` object, Paddle automatically sets a minimum of `1` and a maximum of `100` for you. This means the most units that a customer can buy is 100. Set a quantity if you'd like to offer a different amount.

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the new price entity.

        Creates a new transaction.

        Transactions are typically created with the status of `draft` or `ready` initially:

        * Draft transactions have `items` against them, but don't have all of the required fields for billing. Paddle creates draft transactions automatically when a checkout is opened.
        * Paddle automatically marks transactions as `ready` when all of the required fields are present for billing. This includes `customer_id` and `address_id` for automatically-collected transactions, and `billing_details` for manually-collected transactions.

        The `collection_mode` against a transaction determines how Paddle tries to collect for payment:

        * Manually-collected transactions are for sales-assisted billing. Paddle sends an invoice to your customer when a transaction is `billed`. Payment is often by wire transfer.
        * Automatically-collected transactions are for self-serve checkouts. You may pass the transaction to a checkout or use the returned `checkout.url` to collect for payment.

        When a manually-collected transaction is marked as `billed` or an automatically-collected transaction is `completed`, Paddle automatically creates a related subscription for the items on the transaction.

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the new transaction entity.

        Use the `include` parameter to include related entities in the response.

        Previews calculations for one or more prices. Typically used for building pricing pages.

        You can provide location information when previewing prices. You must provide this if you want Paddle to calculate tax or [automatically localize prices](https://developer.paddle.com/build/products/offer-localized-pricing). You can provide one of:

        * `customer_ip_address`: Paddle fetches location using the IP address to calculate totals.
        * `address`: Paddle uses the country and ZIP code (where supplied) to calculate totals.
        * `customer_id`, `address_id`, `business_id`: Paddle uses existing customer data to calculate totals. Typically used for logged-in customers.

        If successful, your response includes the data you sent with a `details` object that includes totals for the supplied prices.

        Each line item includes `formatted_unit_totals` and `formatted_totals` objects that return totals formatted for the country or region you're working with, including the currency symbol.

        You can work with the preview prices operation using the [`Paddle.PricePreview()`](https://developer.paddle.com/paddlejs/methods/paddle-pricepreview) method in Paddle.js. When working with `Paddle.PricePreview()`, request and response fields are `camelCase` rather than `snake_case`.

        Previews a transaction without creating a transaction entity. Typically used for creating more advanced, dynamic pricing pages where users can build their own plans.

        Consider using [the preview prices operation](https://developer.paddle.com/api-reference/pricing-preview/preview-prices) for simpler pricing pages.

        You can provide location information when previewing a transaction. You must provide this if you want Paddle to calculate tax or [automatically localize prices](https://developer.paddle.com/build/products/offer-localized-pricing). You can provide one of:

        * `customer_ip_address`: Paddle fetches location using the IP address to calculate totals.
        * `address`: Paddle uses the country and ZIP code (where supplied) to calculate totals.
        * `customer_id`, `address_id`, `business_id`: Paddle uses existing customer data to calculate totals. Typically used for logged-in customers.

        When supplying items, you can exclude items from the total calculation using the `include_in_totals` boolean.

        By default, recurring items with trials are considered to have a zero charge when previewing. Set `ignore_trials` to `true` to ignore trial periods against prices for transaction preview calculations.

        If successful, your response includes the data you sent with a `details` object that includes totals for the supplied prices.

        Transaction previews don't create transactions, so no `id` is returned.

        Updates a transaction using its ID.

        You can update transactions that are `draft` or `ready`. `billed` and `completed` transactions are considered records for tax and legal purposes, so they can't be changed. You can either:

        * Create [an adjustment](https://developer.paddle.com/api-reference/adjustments/overview) to record a refund or credit for a transaction.
        * Cancel a `billed` transaction by sending a PATCH request to set `status` to `canceled`.

        The transaction `status` may only be set to `billed` or `canceled`. Other statuses are set automatically by Paddle. Set a manually-collected transaction to `billed` to mark it as finalized. This is essentially issuing an invoice. At this point, it becomes a legal record so you can't make changes to it. Paddle automatically assigns an invoice number, creates [a related subscription](https://developer.paddle.com/api-reference/subscriptions/overview), and sends it to your customer.

        When making changes to items on a transaction, send the complete list of items that you'd like to be on a transaction — including existing items. For each item, send an object containing `price_id` and `quantity`. Paddle responds with the full `price` object for each item. See: [Work with lists](https://developer.paddle.com/api-reference/about/lists)

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the updated transaction entity.

        Revises customer information for a billed or completed transaction.

        Revise a transaction to rectify incorrect customer, address, or business information on invoice documents generated by Paddle.

        You can revise transaction details that don't impact the tax rates on a transaction. This includes:

        * Customer name
        * Business name and tax or VAT number (`tax_identifier`)
        * Address details, apart from the country

        You can't remove a valid tax or VAT number, only replace it with another valid one. If a valid tax or VAT number is added, Paddle automatically creates an adjustment to refund any tax where applicable.

        Transactions can only be revised once.

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the transaction entity. [Get a transaction](https://developer.paddle.com/api-reference/transactions/get-transaction) using the `include` parameter with the `customer`, `address`, and `business` values to see the revised customer information.

        Only the customer information for this transaction is updated. The related customer, address, and business entities aren't updated.

        Creates an adjustment for one or more transaction items.

        You can create adjustments to refund or credit all or part of a transaction and its items:

        * Refunds return an amount to a customer's original payment method. You can create refund adjustments for transactions that are `completed`.
        * Credits reduce the amount that a customer has to pay for a transaction. You can create credit adjustments for manually-collected transactions that are `billed` or `past_due`.

        You can create adjustments to refund transactions that are `completed`, or to reduce the amount to due on manually-collected transactions that are `billed` or `past_due`.
        Most refunds for live accounts are created with the status of `pending_approval` until reviewed by Paddle, but [some are automatically approved](https://developer.paddle.com/build/transactions/create-transaction-adjustments#background-refunds). For sandbox accounts, Paddle automatically approves refunds every ten minutes.

        Adjustments can apply to some or all items on a transaction. You'll need the Paddle ID of the transaction to create a refund or credit for, along with the Paddle ID of any transaction items (`details.line_items[].id`).

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the new adjustment entity.

        Returns a list of credit balances for each currency for a customer. Each balance has three totals:

        * `available`: total available to use.
        * `reserved`: total temporarily reserved for billed transactions.
        * `used`: total amount of credit used.

        Credit is added to the `available` total initially. When used, it moves to the `used` total.

        The `reserved` total is used when a credit balance is applied to a transaction that's marked as `billed`, like when working with an issued invoice. It's not available for other transactions at this point, but isn't considered `used` until the transaction is completed. If a `billed` transaction is `canceled`, any reserved credit moves back to `available`.

        Credit balances are created automatically by Paddle when you take an action that results in Paddle creating a credit for a customer, like making prorated changes to a subscription. An empty `data` array is returned where a customer has no credit balances.

        The response is not paginated.

        Returns a paginated list of payment methods that a customer has saved.  Use the query parameters to page through results.

        When customers sign up for a subscription using Paddle Checkout, Paddle saves the payment method for renewals, upgrades and downgrades, and other charges related to that subscription.

        Customers can also choose to save payment methods when purchasing one-time items by checking a box when completing checkout. You can present customers with their saved payment methods when they make a purchase in the future.

        Returns an empty list where customers have not saved any payment methods, or have deleted all previously saved payment methods.

        Creates a new notification setting (notification destination).

        Pass an array of event type names to `subscribed_events` to say which events you'd like to subscribe to. Paddle responds with the full event type object for each event type.

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the new notification setting entity. Use the returned `endpoint_secret_key` for webhook signature verification.

        Updates a notification setting (notification destination) using its ID.

        When updating subscribed events, send the complete list of event types that you'd like to subscribe to — including existing event types. If you omit event types, they're removed from the notification setting.

        You only need to pass an event type name. Paddle responds with the full event type object for each event type.

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the updated notification setting entity.

        Deletes a notification setting (notification destination) using its ID.

        When you delete a notification setting, it's permanently removed from your account. Paddle stops sending events to your destination, and you'll lose access to all the logs for this notification setting.

        There's no way to recover a deleted notification setting. Deactivate a notification setting using the update notification setting operation if you'll need access to the logs or want to reactivate later on.

        Attempts to resend a `delivered` or `failed` notification using its ID.

        Paddle creates a new notification entity for the replay, related to the same `event_id`. Your response includes the new `notification_id` of the created notification.

        Notifications older than 90 days aren't retained. If you try to replay a notification that's no longer retained, Paddle returns an error.

        Only notifications with the `origin` of `event` can be replayed. You can't replay a notification created for a replay.

        Creates a new simulation for a notification setting (notification destination).

        For scenario simulations, you can optionally include a `config.entities` object in the request body with entity IDs to populate
        simulated webhook payloads with real data. The API key making the request needs read permissions:

        * For the entities you provided, or the request fails.
        * For related entities which aren't nested in the entities you provided, or static examples will be used instead.

        For example, when creating a subscription renewal scenario simulation with an API key that has a `subscription.read` permission but not a `transaction.read` permission,
        the request succeeds and the subscription data will be used in simulated payloads, but the related transaction data won't be used in payloads and falls back to a static example.

        If you don't provide a `config.entities` object, simulated webhook payloads are populated with static examples.

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the new simulation entity.

        Returns a link to an invoice PDF for a transaction.

        Invoice PDFs are available for both automatically and manually-collected transactions:

        * The PDF for manually-collected transactions includes payment terms, purchase order number, and notes for your customer. It's a demand for payment from your customer. It's available for transactions that are `billed` or `completed`.
        * The PDF for automatically-collected transactions lets your customer know that payment was taken successfully. Customers may require this for for tax-reporting purposes. It's available for transactions that are `completed`.

        Invoice PDFs aren't available for zero-value transactions.

        The link returned is not a permanent link. It expires after an hour.

        Updates a subscription using its ID.

        When making changes to items or the next billing date for a subscription, you must include the `proration_billing_mode` field to tell Paddle how to bill for those changes.

        Send the complete list of items that you'd like to be on a subscription — including existing items. If you omit items, they're removed from the subscription.

        For each item, send `price_id` and `quantity`. Paddle responds with the full price object for each price. If you're updating an existing item, you can omit the `quantity` if you don't want to update it.

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the updated subscription entity. When an update results in an immediate charge, responses may take longer than usual while a payment attempt is processed.

        Cancels a subscription using its ID.

        By default, active subscriptions are canceled at the end of the billing period. When you send a request to cancel, Paddle creates a `scheduled_change` against the subscription entity to say that it should cancel at the end of the current billing period. Its `status` remains `active` until after the effective date of the scheduled change, at which point it changes to `canceled`.

        You can cancel a subscription right away by including `effective_from` in your request, setting the value to `immediately`. If successful, your response includes a copy of the updated subscription entity with the `status` of `canceled`. Canceling immediately is the default behavior for paused subscriptions.

        You can't reinstate a canceled subscription.

        Pauses a subscription using its ID.

        By default, subscriptions are paused at the end of the billing period. When you send a request to pause, Paddle creates a `scheduled_change` against the subscription entity to say that it should pause at the end of the current billing period. Its `status` remains `active` until after the effective date of the scheduled change, at which point it changes to `paused`.

        You can pause a subscription right away by including `effective_from` in your request, setting the value to `immediately`. If successful, your response includes a copy of the updated subscription entity with the `status` of `paused`.

        To set a resume date, include the `resume_at` field in your request. The subscription remains paused until the resume date, or until you send a resume request. Omit to create an open-ended pause. The subscription remains paused indefinitely, until you send a resume request.

        Resumes a paused subscription using its ID. Only `paused` subscriptions can be resumed. If an `active` subscription has a scheduled change to pause in the future, use this operation to set or change the resume date.

        You can't resume a `canceled` subscription.

        On resume, Paddle bills for a subscription immediately by default. Subscription billing dates are recalculated based on the resume date. Use the `on_resume` field to change this behavior.

        If successful, Paddle returns a copy of the updated subscription entity:

        * When resuming a `paused` subscription immediately, the subscription status is `active`, and billing dates are updated to reflect the resume date.
        * When scheduling a `paused` subscription to resume on a date in the future, the subscription status is `paused`, and `scheduled_change.resume_at` is updated to reflect the scheduled resume date.
        * When changing the resume date for an `active` subscription that's scheduled to pause, the subscription status is `active` and `scheduled_change.resume_at` is updated to reflect the scheduled resume date.

        This operation may result in an immediate charge, so responses may take longer than usual while a payment attempt is processed.

        Activates a trialing subscription using its ID. Only automatically-collected subscriptions where the status is `trialing` can be activated.

        On activation, Paddle bills for a subscription immediately. Subscription billing dates are recalculated based on the activation date (the time the activation request is made).

        If successful, Paddle returns a copy of the updated subscription entity. The subscription status is `active`, and billing dates are updated to reflect the activation date.

        This operation results in an immediate charge, so responses may take longer than usual while a payment attempt is processed.

        Returns a transaction that you can pass to a checkout to let customers update their payment details. Only for subscriptions where `collection_mode` is `automatic`.

        The transaction returned depends on the status of the related subscription:

        * Where a subscription is `past_due`, it returns the most recent `past_due` transaction.
        * Where a subscription is `active`, it creates a new zero amount transaction for the items on a subscription.

        You can use the returned `checkout.url`, or pass the returned transaction ID to Paddle.js to open a checkout to present customers with a way of updating their payment details.

        The `customer`, `address`, `business`, `discount`, `adjustments` and `adjustments_totals` properties are only returned in the response if the API key has read permissions for those related entities.

        Previews an update for a subscription without applying those changes. Typically used for previewing proration before making changes to a subscription.

        If successful, your response includes `immediate_transaction`, `next_transaction`, and `recurring_transaction_details` so you can see expected transactions for the changes.

        The `update_summary` object contains details of prorated credits and charges created, along with the overall result of the update.

        Creates a new one-time charge for a subscription. Use to bill non-recurring items to a subscription. Non-recurring items are price entities where the `billing_cycle` is `null`.

        If successful, Paddle responds with the updated subscription entity. However, one-time charges aren't held against the subscription entity, so the charges billed aren't returned in the response.

        Once created, to get details of a one-time charge:

        * When created with `effective_from` as `next_billing_period`, get the subscription the charge was billed to and use the `include` query parameter with the `next_transaction` value.
        * When created with `effective_from` as `immediately`, list transactions and use the `subscription_id` query parameter with the subscription ID of the subscription the charge was billed to.

        When an update results in an immediate charge, responses may take longer than usual while a payment attempt is processed.

        Previews creating a one-time charge for a subscription without billing that charge. Typically used for previewing calculations before making changes to a subscription.

        One-time charges are non-recurring items. These are price entities where the `billing_cycle` is `null`.

        If successful, your response includes `immediate_transaction`, `next_transaction`, and `recurring_transaction_details` so you can see expected transactions for the changes.

        Reports are created as `pending` initially while Paddle generates your report. They move to `ready` when they're ready to download.

        You can download a report when it's ready using the [get a CSV file for a report operation](https://developer.paddle.com/api-reference/reports/get-report-csv).

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the new report entity.

        Occurs when an adjustment is updated.

        This only occurs for `refund` adjustments, which must be approved by Paddle and are created as `pending_approval`
        initially. On review, they move to `approved` or `rejected` and `adjustment.updated` occurs.

        Occurs when a transaction is billed. Its `status` field changes to `billed` and `billed_at` is populated.

        Marking a transaction as billed is typically used when working with manually-collected transactions to issue an
        invoice. It's not typically part of checkout workflows, where collection mode is automatic.

        Transactions are marked as billed when:

        * You update its status to `billed` using the API.
        * You send an invoice (a manually-collected transaction) using the Paddle dashboard.

        Billed transactions get an invoice number. They're considered legal records, so they can't be deleted or changed.

        [`transaction.updated`](https://developer.paddle.com/webhooks/transactions/transaction-updated) events occur immediately after to add:

        * `invoice_number`, and `invoice_id` if not already present.

        Transactions move to completed after they're `paid`. After a transaction is paid, Paddle starts completed transaction processing. This involves:

        * Logging details of the successful payment against `transaction.payments[]`.
        * Adding information about fees, earnings, and totals for payouts to the transaction entity.
        * For automatically-collected transactions, creating a subscription for any recurring items and adding the related `subscription_id` to the transaction entity.
        * For automatically-collected transactions, adding an `invoice_number` and `invoice_id` to the transaction entity.

        [`transaction.updated`](https://developer.paddle.com/webhooks/transactions/transaction-updated) occurs as Paddle updates a paid transaction.

        When all processing is completed, a transaction is marked as completed and `transaction.completed` occurs.

      description: |-
        Occurs when a transaction is billed. Its `status` field changes to `billed` and `billed_at` is populated.

        Marking a transaction as billed is typically used when working with manually-collected transactions to issue an
        invoice. It's not typically part of checkout workflows, where collection mode is automatic.

        Transactions are marked as billed when:

        * You update its status to `billed` using the API.
        * You send an invoice (a manually-collected transaction) using the Paddle dashboard.

        Billed transactions get an invoice number. They're considered legal records, so they can't be deleted or changed.

        [`transaction.updated`](https://developer.paddle.com/webhooks/transactions/transaction-updated) events occur immediately after to add:

        * `invoice_number`, and `invoice_id` if not already present.
        * If manually-collected, the newly created `subscription_id` for any recurring items.

        Occurs when a transaction is canceled. Its `status` field changes to `canceled`.

        Marking a transaction as canceled is typically used when working with manually-collected transactions to say that an
        invoice was created in error. It's not typically part of checkout workflows, where collection mode is automatic.

        Transactions are marked as canceled when:

        * You update its status to `canceled` using the API.
        * You cancel an invoice (a manually-collected transaction) using the Paddle dashboard.

        Occurs when a transaction is completed. Its status field changes to `completed`.

        Transactions move to completed after they're `paid`. After a transaction is paid, Paddle starts completed transaction processing. This involves:

        * Logging details of the successful payment against `transaction.payments[]`.
        * Adding information about fees, earnings, and totals for payouts to the transaction entity.
        * For automatically-collected transactions, creating a subscription for any recurring items and adding the related `subscription_id` to the transaction entity.
        * For automatically-collected transactions, adding an `invoice_number` and `invoice_id` to the transaction entity.

        [`transaction.updated`](/webhooks/transactions/transaction-updated) occurs as Paddle updates a paid transaction.

        When all processing is completed, a transaction is marked as completed and `transaction.completed` occurs.

        Occurs when a transaction is created. Paddle creates a transaction when:

        * Customers open checkout.
        * You create an invoice in the Paddle dashboard.

        You may also create a transaction using the API:

        * Create a manually-collected transaction to create and send an invoice.
        * Create an automatically-collected transaction and pass to a checkout to collect for payment.

        Where a transaction has `items`, `customer_id`, and `address_id`,
        [`transaction.ready`](https://developer.paddle.com/webhooks/transactions/transaction-ready) occurs immediately after.

        Transactions are paid when payment has been captured successfully, but Paddle hasn't yet fully processed the transaction internally.

        For example:

        * Payout totals may not be present.
        * Automatically-collected transactions for recurring items might not yet have a `subscription_id`.
        * Automatically-collected transactions might not yet have an `invoice_number`.

        Transactions move to `completed` and [`transaction.completed`](/webhooks/transactions/transaction-completed) occurs when they're fully processed.

      description: |-
        Occurs when a transaction is ready to be billed. Its `status` field changes to `ready`.

        Transactions are ready when they have all the required fields against them to be transitioned to `billed` or
        `completed`. This includes `items`, `customer_id`, and `address_id`. Paddle automatically marks transactions as
        `ready` when these fields are present.

        When working with manually-collected transactions (invoices), [`transaction.updated`](https://developer.paddle.com/webhooks/transactions/transaction-updated)
        may occur immediately after to add `invoice_id` and `adjusted_totals`.
