# Description

The `associations` package is a standalone feature responsible for collecting associated or related objects for a given HubSpot CRM object.

# Usage

This package is utilized by several core features, including:
- **Search feature**: To include associated object data in search results.
- **Read feature**: To fetch relationships when reading specific records.
- **GetRecordsByIds feature**: To collect associated objects for a specific set of record identifiers.

It is designed as a standalone component to handle the complexities of HubSpot's association API independently of other CRM operations.
