  Broadcast Collection: |
    ### What is it?
    
    Represents broadcast messages associated with a specific list.
    
    Use this set of resources to create, retrieve, modify, schedule, and delete broadcast
    messages on a list.
    
    The broadcast collection is paginated in pages of 100 items by default and sorted based
    on the message status.  Each response page includes `next_collection_link` and
    `prev_collection_link` properties to traverse the collection.  See
    [How Collections are Represented](#collection-representation) for traversal details and the
    following table for sorting.
