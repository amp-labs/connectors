          The datatype of the value attribute may be different for each Stat.
          Stats can be integer_stat, decimal_stat, or list_stat. Evaluate the

          different datatypes in a special way.

          Unique list ID of list.

          The unique list ID is the automatically generated name for your list.

          If you create a custom sign up form, you'll need to specify the unique list ID in the form's HTML code, ensuring that subscribers will be added to the list.

          The unique list ID is also the first part of your autoresponder's e-mail address used by subscribers to sign up to your list.

          A subscriber can sign up to your list by sending an email to this address. (Though this method is rarely used anymore.)
