      ### **Do I need to be an AWeber customer to develop an application?**
      ------------
      To develop an API application, you will need to <a href='https://labs.aweber.com' target="_blank">
      open an AWeber Labs account</a> which is 100% free and entirely unrelated to AWeber customer accounts.                          
    
      If you are not an AWeber customer already, you may also want to
      <a href='https://www.aweber.com/order.htm' target="_blank">create an AWeber customer account</a>
      using a free 1 month trial. This account can be used to test the API application
      which you are developing.
    
      ### **How does AWeber's API handle user authentication?**
      ------------
      The AWeber API uses OAuth to handle authenticating requests on behalf of AWeber users.  OAuth provides 
      a standardized way for providing third party applications access to a user's data without the need for that
      customer to give out their username and password. For more information on how authentication is implemented
      in the AWeber API, please read [our authentication guide][0].
    
      ### **What character encoding does the API use?**
      ------------
      The AWeber API uses <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8' target="_blank">UTF-8</a> character encoding.
      UTF-8 was chosen due to its widespread usage online and is supported by a majority of the programming
      languages in use today.

      When passing data to the AWeber API, it's up to the app developer to ensure that the data is sent to us using
      the proper character encoding.  The API will return a <a href='https://api.aweber.com#badrequest' target="_blank">
      Bad Request</a> with 'Invalid Character Encoding' if the data sent to the API is not UTF-8 encoded.
    
      ### **How do I update customer account information / add subscribers?**
      ------------
      You can add a subscriber to a list by invoking the [POST Subscriber][1] endpoint.
      Please refer to our <a class="php" href="https://github.com/aweber/public-api-examples/tree/master/php/manage-subscriber" target="_blank">php</a> and <a class="python" href="https://github.com/aweber/public-api-examples/tree/master/python/manage-subscriber" target="_blank">python</a> code samples for examples of adding Subscribers.</p>
    
      Customer account information cannot currently be edited via the API.
      Please refer to our [reference documentation][2] or [changelog][3] for more details.
    
      ### **What formats of data are returned by the AWeber API?**
      ------------
      All requests in the AWeber API, including error messages, are returned as JSON formatted strings.  JSON was chosen 
      due to its ease of readability and because it is well supported in a large number of languages.
    
      ### **How many requests can my application make in a given amount of time?**
      ------------
      AWeber API requests are limited to 120 requests per minute, per customer account.
