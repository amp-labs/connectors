    ### What is it?
    
    Represents the 3rd Party Services that are integrated with the AWeber Customer Account.
    
    Use this set of resources to retrieve the integrations that are available for
    use when creating broadcasts.  For example, use the integration `self_link`
    as a parameter when [creating a broadcast](#tag/Broadcasts/paths/~1accounts~1{accountId}~1lists~1{listId}~1broadcasts/post) to cross-post to Twitter and Facebook
    when a broadcast is sent. The integrations returned include Facebook, Twitter,
    PayPal and Shopify, if connected.
    
    The collection response is sorted by the generated integration `id` and paginated using `next_collection_link` and `prev_collection_link` properties.  See
    [How Collections are Represented](#collection-representation) for details on collection
    traversal.
