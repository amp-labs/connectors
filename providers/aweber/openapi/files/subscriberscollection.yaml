  Subscribers Collection: |
    ### What is it?
    
    Represents a collection of subscribers.
    
    Use this set of resources to add, remove, find, and update an AWeber Customer Account's subscribers.
    The collection responses are ordered and paginated using `next_collection_link` and
    `prev_collection_link` properties.  See [How Collections are Represented](#collection-representation)
    for details on collection traversal and the individual endpoint descriptions for ordering constraints.
    Many of the subscriber-related endpoints support the `sort_order` query parameter to control the sorting
    *direction* in the response collection.
    
    Subscribers are one of the most important elements in the AWeber API so care must be taken before
    adding a subscriber to a list.  Read more about adding subscribers in AWeber Knowledge Base article

    "Can I use this list?"</a>.
    
    Although not required, it's strongly recommended that you provide the IP address of the Subscriber if
    it is known.  For web based Apps, the `ip_address` that you should use is the REMOTE_ADDRESS of their
    requests to your App server, not the server's IP address.  The IP address is used in the Geo Location
    parameters and for send windows in the AWeber Control Panel.  **The IP address can only be specified
    when ADDING a new subscriber.**
