    ## Getting Started
    
    AWeber offers support for webhooks including `subscriber.added`, `subscriber.subscribed` and `subscriber.unsubscribed`
    events.  The integration will receive notifications when the events occur for each AWeber User Account that is
    connected.  The notifications are sent to a callback URL that is configured by the AWeber User when they connect
    your integration.  You will need to provide the valid patterns for the URLs that your integration will receive
    notifications on.
    
    When you create or edit an integration, you enable webhooks by:
    
    1. providing one or more URL prefixes as the **Callback URL Allow-list**
    2. selecting one or more events to be notified for
    
    The *Callback URL Allow-list* is the list of **exact** URL prefixes that can be configured by the AWeber User
    when they connect their account to your integration.  For example, if the "allow list" contains
    ``https://example.com/api`` then customers can use any callback URL that starts with ``https://example.com/api``
    including ``https://example.com/api/V1StGXR8_Z5jdHi6B-myT``, ``https://example.com/api/1A2E05D9-741D-4F1C-8937-6DFD984840ED``,
    or even ``https://example.com/api-unexpected-suffix``.  *You usually want to end "allow list" entries with an
    explicit ``/`` to avoid that last one.*
    
    ### Authorizing Webhooks[](#authorizing-webhooks)
    
    To authorize your webhooks-enabled integration, you will need to grant the
    `subscriber.read` and `account.read` permissions from your AWeber User Account.
    For more information about AWeber OAuth scopes see
    <a href='https://help.aweber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021487653' target='_blank'>here</a>.
    
    Open an OAuth 2.0 authorize URL in your browser:  
    
        https://auth.aweber.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&scope=subscriber.read%20account.read
    
    Replace **{client_id}** with the Client ID of your webhooks-enabled integration. The Client ID
    is available in your AWeber Developer account. The `scope` parameter may be any valid set of
    scopes as long as it contains `subscriber.read` and `account.read`.
    
    You may continue the OAuth 2.0 flow to retrieve an access token if you need one. More detailed
    instructions on OAuth 2.0 are available 
    <a href='https://help.aweber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021258174' target='_blank'>here</a>.
    
    ### Providing a Callback URL
    
    Once authorized, you must configure the callback URL for your webhooks-enabled integration in
    the AWeber control panel.  This is required to match a prefix in your integration's **Callback URL Allow-list**.
    
    Open this <a href='https://www.aweber.com/users/apps' target='_blank'>link</a> in your browser.
    
    You may be prompted to log in with your AWeber User Account (not your AWeber Developer Account).
    
    <a href="/static/myapps.png" target="_blank"><img class="myapps" alt="[My Apps]" src="/static/myapps.png"></a>
    
    Click on your integration in the list of connected integrations.
    
    <a href="/static/webhookapp.png" target="_blank"><img class="webhookapp" alt="[My Apps]" src="/static/webhookapp.png"></a>
    
    Enter the URL to receive webhook requests in the **Webhook URL** field (1) and press the **Save** button (2).
    The URL you entered must match the whitelisted base URL you provided to us when your integration was set up.
    Your test account should start receiving webhooks at that URL.
    
    If no Webhook URL field is visible, the selected application does not have webhooks enabled.
    
    <p style='color: red'>If the Webhook URL field is disabled, your test user has not authorized webhooks yet.
    See the <a href='/#authorizing-webhooks'><strong>Authorizing Webhooks</strong></a> section for more information.</p>
    
    ### How do I trigger a webhook?
    
    Navigate to the Sign Up Forms screen <a href='https://www.aweber.com/users/web_forms' target='_blank'>here</a>.
    If you aren’t logged in, you will need to provide your AWeber Customer Account credentials.
    Click the **Publish** link for the desired sign up form.
    
    <a href="/static/publishform.png" target="_blank"><img class="publishform" alt="[My Apps]" src="/static/publishform.png"></a>
    
    When the Publish screen appears, click on the **Use My Form as a Landing Page** section.
    Copy and paste the URL provided into a new window. Complete the fields on the sign up form.
    This will trigger our `subscriber.added` webhook outlined further down in this document.
    
    ***Alternatively:*** You can add subscribers via our 
    <a href='/#tag/Subscribers/paths/~1accounts~1{accountId}~1lists~1{listId}~1subscribers/post'>Add Subscriber</a>
    endpoint in our API.
    
    ## Verifying Webhook Payloads
    
    ### Procedure
    
    When you receive a request to your webhook URL, you should first verify that the request came from AWeber.  The
    **Verification Key** is the key of an HMAC-SHA256 hash of the request's `Date` header and request body.
    
    The message to hash is constructed by:  
    `rstrip('date:' + date_header_value + '\n' + request_body)`
    
    Where:
    - `rstrip` is a function that removes all space, tab, line feed, carriage return, vertical tab, and form feed characters (0x20, 0x09, 0x0a, 0x0d, 0x0b, and 0x0c) from the end of a string
    - `date_header_value` is the value of the `Date` request header
    - `request_body` is the full HTTP request body
    
    ### Example
    
    Given this HTTP Request
    
    ```
    POST /my-callback HTTP/1.1
    AWeber-Delivery-ID: 238D534C-2101-4440-98D7-7404938C3675
    AWeber-Signature: sha256=74856469e8a97c0939a8d398460e1ffc83e4e40a46e657c61e9d3723035df10a
    Content-Length: 130
    Content-Type: application/vnd.aweber.webhook+json; version=1.0
    Date: Mon, 21 Oct 2019 19:05:20 GMT
    
    
    {"account": null
    ,"client_id": "fKcKvImyD2pQmRDWYSFx92rReytdL4Jh"
    ,"callback": "5AB10F8A-EC5A-40E8-AF0B-7DC8DF580E55"
    ,"data": []}
    ```
    
    The message to verify would be:
    ```
    date:Mon, 21 Oct 2019 19:05:20 GMT\n{"account": null\n,"client_id": "fKcKvImyD2pQmRDWYSFx92rReytdL4Jh"\n,"callback":"5AB10F8A-EC5A-40E8-AF0B-7DC8DF580E55"\n,"data": []}
    ```
    
    Given a base64 encoded verification key `bXktdmVyaWZpY2F0aW9uLWtleQ==` the expected signature can be calculated:
    ```
    sha256hmac(key=b64decode('bXktdmVyaWZpY2F0aW9uLWtleQ=='), message='date:Mon, 21 Oct 2019 19:05:20 GMT\n{"account": null\n,"client_id": "fKcKvImyD2pQmRDWYSFx92rReytdL4Jh"\n,"callback": "5AB10F8A-EC5A-40E8-AF0B-7DC8DF580E55"\n,"data": []}')
    ```
    
    The result, `74856469e8a97c0939a8d398460e1ffc83e4e40a46e657c61e9d3723035df10a`, should match the hex digest following `sha256=`
     from the `AWeber-Signature` header.
    
    Once the message has been verified, you should check that the `client_id` field matches the Client ID of your integration.
    
    ### Python Verification Script
    
    The following Python script implements webhook verification. It defines these variables:  
    - `request_headers`: a dictionary mapping HTTP request headers to their values
    - `request_body`: the full HTTP request body
    - `key_b64`: the base64 encoded verification key
    
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import base64
    import hmac
    
    request_headers = {
        'Date': 'Mon, 21 Oct 2019 19:05:20 GMT',
        'AWeber-Signature': ('sha256=74856469e8a97c0939a8d398460e1ffc83e4e40a46e65'
                             '7c61e9d3723035df10a'),
    }
    
    request_body = b"""\
    {"account": null
    ,"client_id": "fKcKvImyD2pQmRDWYSFx92rReytdL4Jh"
    ,"callback": "5AB10F8A-EC5A-40E8-AF0B-7DC8DF580E55"
    ,"data": []}"""
    
    key_b64 = 'bXktdmVyaWZpY2F0aW9uLWtleQ=='
    
    # The verification key is encoded in base64
    key = base64.b64decode(key_b64)
    
    # The AWeber-Signature header contains the hash type and hash separated by '='
    alg, _, expected_hash = request_headers['AWeber-Signature'].partition('=')
    if alg != 'sha256':
        raise ValueError('Unexpected hash type: ' + alg)
    
    message = (b'date:' +
               request_headers['Date'].encode('utf-8') +
               b'\n' +
               request_body)
    calculated_hash = hmac.HMAC(key, msg=message.rstrip(), digestmod='SHA256')
    if calculated_hash.hexdigest() != expected_hash:
        raise ValueError('Invalid signature')
    
    print('Signature validated!')
    ```
    
    ## Returning a Response
    
    If you successfully process the message, you should return a **200** status code in your response. The response body will be ignored.
    
    If you return a non-2XX level status code due to a failure, we may retry the message or stop sending webhooks entirely. 
    
    ## Webhook Reference

    ## Considerations
    
    Webhooks are not guaranteed to be published. They are sent on a best effort basis. To catch any events you may have missed, you should query the API with a scheduled job.
    
    Duplicate webhook requests may be sent. To prevent taking action on a message that you have already received, you can use the `AWeber-Delivery-ID` as a unique identifier for that message.
    
    You should not rely on the order in which webhook messages are published. Due to differences in processing time, they may arrive out of order.
