  Custom Fields Collection: |
    ### What is it?
    
    Represents the custom fields associated with a list.
    
    Use this set of resources to retrieve, create, modify, and delete the custom fields that
    are defined for subscribers on the list.  The single collection response is sorted by the
    generated custom field `id` and paginated using `next_collection_link` and
    `prev_collection_link` properties.  See [How Collections are Represented](#collection-representation)
    for details on collection traversal.
    
    ### Warning about modifying Custom Fields
    
    Modifying or deleting a custom field has a number of side-effects that need to be understood
    *BEFORE* you change them.  See
