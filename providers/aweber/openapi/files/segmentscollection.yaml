    ### What is it?
    
    Represents the segments associated with a list.
    
    Use this resource to retrieve the segments that are defined for the list.  The single collection
    response is sorted by the generated segment `id` and paginated using `next_collection_link` and
    `prev_collection_link` properties.  See
    [How Collections are Represented](#collection-representation) for details on collection traversal.
