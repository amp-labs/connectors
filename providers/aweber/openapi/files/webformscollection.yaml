    ### What is it?
    
    Represents the collection of sign-up forms associated with the AWeber Customer
    Account's lists.
    
    Webforms are sets of customized HTML and javascript that are used to put up a sign-up forms
    on a customer's website.  The Webform can be modified in the AWeber Control Panel and if you
    include the javascript source link on any web page, that form will be displayed.
    
    Webforms can also be subject to split-tests to compare conversion effectiveness.  Webforms that
    belong to a split test are listed as *components* of the split test and can be retrieved by
    following the `components_collection_link` of the split test. The statistics of each component
    include only displays of that Webform where it was displayed from a split test.
    
    Use this set of resources to retrieve information about the available sign-up forms and associated
    split tests.  The collection responses are sorted by the appropriate identifier and paginated using
    `next_collection_link` and `prev_collection_link` properties. See
    [How Collections are Represented](#collection-representation) for details on collection traversal.
