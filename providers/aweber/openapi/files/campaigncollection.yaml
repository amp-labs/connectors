    ### What is it?
    
    Represents followup and broadcast messages associated with a list.
    
    **The Campaigns email automation platform within the AWeber web platform is not
    currently supported by the AWeber API.**
    
    Use this set of resources to retrieve information and statistics for messages on a list by type
    of message (e.g., *followup* or *broadcast*).  The collection responses are sorted based on
    message type and paginated using `next_collection_link` and `prev_collection_link` properties.
    See [How Collections are Represented](#collection-representation) for details on collection
    traversal and the individual endpoints for sorting characteristics.
