# Testing

# Conventions
- [ ] Provider name is camelcase (`goTo` and not `goto`)
- [ ] Should cover all modules within the connector (ex, `goTo` has modules `webinar` and `meeting` or `google` has modules `drive` and `calendar`)
- [ ] Base URLs do NOT have version information
- [ ] DocsURLs actually link to user-friendly documentation (do not link to very technical documentation)
- [ ] All required metadata variables are templated (`{{.var}}`) and defined in `ProviderInfo.Metadata`
- [ ] If OAuth2 connector, if `workspace` is required, `Oauth2Opts.ExplicitWorkspaceRequired` is ALSO set to true
- [ ] Basic smoke tests added (valid request succeeds, invalid request fails)
- [ ] Docs and logos attached or linked
- [ ] Modules are only being added because:
  - [ ] The same base URL cannot be used to make a proxy call to objects in all modules
  - [ ] Different base URLs (drive.google.com vs google.com)
  - [ ] Object name collisions (same object name exists in two or more modules)
